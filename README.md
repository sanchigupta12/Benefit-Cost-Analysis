# Benefit-Cost Analysis of Dam Projects using Monte Carlo Simulation

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of two proposed dam projects using Monte Carlo simulations. By leveraging stochastic methods, this analysis models and predicts outcomes where direct calculation is impractical due to the inherent variability in project costs and benefits. The report specifically compares the benefit-cost ratios for Dam #1 and Dam #2 to provide insights into their potential performance and risks.

## Contents

- **Introduction**: Overview of Monte Carlo simulations and their significance in decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Analysis**:
  - **Part 1**: Simulation of benefit-cost ratios for both dams, including frequency distribution and statistical measures.
  - **Part 2**: Calculation of estimates and chi-squared tests to assess the fit of a triangular distribution.
  - **Part 3**: Performance and risk analysis of the dams based on the simulated benefit-cost ratios.
- **Recommendation**: Analysis-driven recommendation to management on which dam project to pursue based on the simulation results.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of the findings and the overall recommendation.

## Key Findings

- **Dam #1** shows a slightly higher mean and median benefit-cost ratio compared to Dam #2.
- The variability in benefit-cost ratios is similar for both dams, but Dam #2 has a slightly higher standard deviation, indicating more risk.
- Skewness analysis suggests that Dam #1's benefit-cost distribution is closer to normal, while Dam #2 has a right-skewed distribution, potentially yielding higher ratios.
- Based on the Monte Carlo simulations and the resulting statistical analysis, **Dam #1** is recommended for investment due to its marginally better expected performance and similar risk profile.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Used to model the variability in project costs and benefits over 10,000 iterations.
- **Frequency Distribution Analysis**: Evaluated the distribution of benefit-cost ratios for both dams.
- **Chi-Squared Test**: Assessed the fit of the triangular distribution to the simulated data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculated key statistical measures (mean, median, variance, skewness) to compare the performance and risk of both dams.
